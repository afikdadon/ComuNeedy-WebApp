### ComuNeedy Web Application

### Project Overview
ComuNeedy is a web application designed to connect volunteers with individuals seeking various services. The platform allows service applicants to submit requests and receive support from suitable volunteers. The site includes features for user registration, request management, and feedback submission, ensuring an efficient and user-friendly experience for those seeking help.
